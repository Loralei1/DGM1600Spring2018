Look at this trench, 
Isnt' it neat? 
Wouldn't you say that our dig is complete? 
Wouldn't you say we're the crew, 
The crew who dug everything. 

Just look at this square. 
There's no treasures I'm told. 
And how many fish bones can one bucket hold?
Lookin' around here you think, sure--
They dug everything. 

We've got lithics and proj points a'plenty. 
We've got manos and potsherds galore. 
And trout vertebrae? WE HAVE PLENTY.
But who cares?
No big deal. 
I want moooooooooooorrre.

I wanna be where the Fremont were. 
I wanna see--wanna see their structures.
Building there homes with that--what's that stuff again?
Oh. Adobe.
