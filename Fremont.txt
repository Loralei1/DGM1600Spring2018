This, and I'm not kidding, is something my classmates and I sung at our archaeological fieldschool to pass the time. We were doing an excavation near the Provo airport, right up next to the lake, and we were all tired of finding calcined fish vertebrae and almost nothing else. Unfortunately, we never sang the whole song, which is why it only goes as far as it does. 

I really don't know WHY we started singing an archaeolical parody of 'Part of Your World,' though. That was kinda weird. 

Look at this trench, 
Isnt' it neat? 
Wouldn't you say that our dig is complete? 
Wouldn't you say we're the crew, 
The crew who dug everything. 

Just look at this square. 
There's no treasures I'm told. 
And how many fish bones can one bucket hold?
Lookin' around here you think, sure--
They dug everything. 

We've got lithics and proj points a'plenty. 
We've got manos and potsherds galore. 
And trout vertebrae? WE HAVE PLENTY.
But who cares?
No big deal. 
I want moooooooooooorrre.

I wanna be where the Fremont were. 
I wanna see--wanna see their structures.
Building there homes with that--what's that stuff again?
Oh. Adobe. 

If they have lot's of stuff they're not walking too far. 
High material culture's more sedentary. 
What they don't have they can get through travel or trade, 
Up where they built, up where they grew
Maize, ricegrass, and sometimes squash too!
Just wait and see, 
I wanna be 
Where the Fremont were. 

Oh what would I give, 
If I could seive without all this water. 
What would I pay 
To spend a day warm seiving through sand. 

But then again, it's kinda hot, 
And the days are getting hotter.
