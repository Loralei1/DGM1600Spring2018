Look at this trench, 
Isnt' it neat? 
Wouldn't you say that our dig is complete? 
Wouldn't you say we're the crew, 
The crew who dug everything. 

I wanna be where the Fremont were. 
I wanna see, wanna see their structures.
Building there homes with that--what's that stuff again?
Oh. Adobe.
