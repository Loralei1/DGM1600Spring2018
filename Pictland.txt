Pictish symbol stones are fairly odd. 

Odd is, perhaps, the wrong word. They aren't odd so much as baffling. While unusual to us, their purpose must have been clear to the Pictish inhabitants of the Scottish lowlands who erected them, as the symbols were widely used and the stones were often erected along what may have been boundary lines even then; a number of stones were found along what are now parish boundaries, boundaries which were likely based on an older system of land ownership.

A description of the stones might be useful here. Pictish symbol stones range from the rough and almost raw standing stones incribed with a symbol or two, perhaps the so-called pictish beast or a double-disc-and-z-rod, to the carefully worked, finished standing slabs, such as the Drosten Stone. 

Part of the confusion stems from conflating the stones and their uses with the meaning of the symbols, and even more from debate as to just how many symbols there are.
